                    Health and fitness should be lifestyle choices. For those who want to lose weight, do it for your
                    health and wellness and not to abide by the beauty standards of the society. Health is beautiful and
                    when you shed-off the extra inches and kilos from your body, you’ll be able to reduce the risk of
                    obesity related health concerns like – heart ailments, hypertension, diabetes, joint pain etc.

                    <br> <br>Weight loss and weight gain are both about calorie consumption and expenditure. you lose weight when
                    you consume fewer calories than you expend and you gain weight when you consume more calories than
                    you sweat. To drop those extra kilos, all you need to do is eat within your calorie budget and burn
                    the required number of calories. So a combination of a healthy and low-fat diet with a proper
                    workout routine will help you lose weight and even maintain it.

                <h3>Whether it is weight loss or weight gain, macronutrients play a pivotal role.<br> The ideal distribution of calories for a beginner as part of fat loss diet plan is:</h3><br>
                <h3><span>Carbs: </span>  50% – 55% <br>
                    <span>Proteins:</span> 35%<br>
                    <span>Fat:</span> 10% – 15% <br></h3>

                    <p>Apart from following a healthy diet plan for weight gain, you can also ask your dietician to
                        recommend a mass gainer or weight gainer supplement. These supplements have the right balance of
                        carbohydrates and protein and provide extra calories needed to gain weight without adding extra
                        fat. </p>
