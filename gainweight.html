            Here’s a sample diet plan that will provide 3000 calories a day. You
            can alter this diet plan based on your age, gender, health
            conditions etc. after consulting your dietician. The simplest way to
            consume more calories is to increase the number of meals and include
            healthy foods that will help you build muscle mass without adding
            any extra fat or flab to your body.<br>
